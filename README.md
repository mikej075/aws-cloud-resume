My primary goal in completing the cloud resume challenge was to deepen my experience with Terraform — a tool I had explored in the past but never fully utilized at scale.

🚀 This challenge was an opportunity to:

🛠️ Rebuild and redeploy my personal website in the cloud /n
🔄 Explore **CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions /n
☁️ Gain practical experience across key AWS services /n
🧱 Strengthen my **Infrastructure as Code** skills /n
🎯 Demonstrate (to myself and future employers) that I can architect and deploy a **full-stack solution** using AWS
