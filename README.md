Why I Took on the Cloud Resume Challenge?
I come from a development and Application/API background, so I've always enjoyed building things. My primary goal in doing this challenge was to deepen my experience with Terraform - a tool I had explored in the past, but never fully utilized at scale.
Beyond that, I saw this challenge as a chance to:
Rebuild and redeploy my personal website in the cloud.
Explore CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
Gain practical experience across key AWS services.
Strengthen my Infrastructure as Code skills.
Demonstrate to myself (and future employers) that I could architect and deploy a full-stack solution using AWS.
